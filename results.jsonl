{"idx": 1, "prompt": "Give me 3 bullet points on why the sky appears blue.", "result": "Here are three bullet points explaining why the sky appears blue:\n\n*   **Rayleigh Scattering:** The Earth's atmosphere is made up of tiny gas molecules, primarily nitrogen and oxygen. When sunlight, which is composed of all colors of the rainbow, enters the atmosphere, these molecules scatter the light in all directions. This phenomenon is called Rayleigh scattering.\n\n*   **Wavelength Dependence:** Blue light has a shorter wavelength than other colors in the visible spectrum, such as red and yellow. Shorter wavelengths are scattered more effectively by the small gas molecules in the atmosphere.\n\n*   **Dominance of Blue Light:** Because blue light is scattered much more than other colors, it appears to come from all directions in the sky. Our eyes are more sensitive to blue light, so we perceive the sky as blue."}
